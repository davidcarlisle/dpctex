% reported by Frank Mittelbach (possibly a long time ago:-)
% \hhline should use arrayrulewidth rather than doublerulesep
% for ~


% The problem initially reported was that ~ would always force =
% spacing even if all the other column entries were only single rule.
% while fixing that, noticed some other problems with hhline support.

% if \doublerulesepcolor was not set, = still used a rule for the
% separation resulting in a blak line rather than space.
% Now the original definition 9more or less) is used in that case

% if  \doublerulesepcolor was set, the colour band should be 
% \doublerulesep+2\arrayrulewidth, to match the band that HH@box
% puts under the rules.
