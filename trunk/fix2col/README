   Superceeded by fixltx2e, part of the base LaTeX distribution.
   Two column fixes.
   a) Fix mark handling so \firstmark is taken from the first column
      if that column has marks at all.
      (A copy of Piet van Oostrum's fixmarks package, more or less.)
   b) Keep two column floats like figure* in sequence with single
      column floats like figure.
      (Modelled on  Ed Sznyter's 2.09 package, fixfloats.)
