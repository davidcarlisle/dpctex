typehtml.dtx
typehtml.ins
   Typeset HTML (ie World Wide web documents) directly from LaTeX.
   Process the file html.ins to produce the html.sty package file.
   Process the file html.dtx to produce examples, documentation and
   code listings. Currently this package can handle almost all of
   HTML2, and most of the math fragment of the draft HTML3.
