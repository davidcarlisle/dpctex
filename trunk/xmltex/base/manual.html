<h2>
<a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>
xmltex      implements
a non     validating parser for documents matching the
W3C XML Namespaces Recommendation.


The system may just be used to parse the file (expanding entity
references and normalising namespace declarations) in which case it
records a trace of the parse on the terminal. Normally however the
information from the parse is used to trigger TeX typesetting code.
Declarations (in TeX syntax) are provided as part of xmltex to
associate TeX code with the start and end of each XML element,
attributes, processing instructions, and with unicode character data.
</p>


<h2>
<a name="manualN211"></a>Installation</h2>

<p>The xmltex parser itself does not require LaTeX. It may be loaded
into initex to produce a format capable of parsing XML files. However
such a format would have no convenient commands for typesetting, and
so normally xmltex will be used on top of an existing format, normally
LaTeX. In this section we assume that the document to be
processed is called <tt>document.xml</tt>.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="manualN228"></a>Using xmltex as an input to the LaTeX command</h3>

<p>LaTeX requires a document in TeX syntax, not XML. To process
<tt>document.xml</tt>, first produce a two line file called
<tt>document.tex</tt> of the following form:
<pre>
\def\xmlfile{document.xml}
\input xmltex.tex
</pre>

Do <em>not</em> put any other commands in this file!</p>
<p>You may then process the document with either of the commands:
<tt>latex document</tt>  or <tt>latex document.tex</tt>
or the equivalent procedure in your TeX environment.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="manualN267"></a>Using xmltex as a TeX format built on LaTeX</h3>

<p>
You may prefer to set up xmltex as a format in its own right.
This may speed things up slightly (as <tt>xmltex.tex</tt> does not
have to be read each time) but more importantly perhaps it allows the
XML file to be processed directly without needing to make the
<tt>.tex</tt> wrapper.</p>
<p>To make a format you will need a command such as the following,
depending on your TeX system.
<pre>
initex &amp;latex xmltex
initex \&amp;latex xmltex
tex -ini &amp;latex xmltex
tex -ini \&amp;latex xmltex
</pre>
</p>
<p>This will produce a format file <tt>xmltex.fmt</tt>. You should then
be able to make a <tt>xmltex</tt> command by copying the way the
<tt>latex</tt> command is defined in terms of
<tt>latex.fmt</tt>. Depending on the TeX system, this might be a
symbolic link, or a shell script, or batch file, or a configuration
option in a setup menu.

</p>

<h3>
<a name="manualN311"></a> Making an xmltex format `from scratch'</h3>

<p>
Whilst it may be convenient to build an xmltex format as above, starting
from the LaTeX format. You may prefer to instead work with an initex
with no existing format file. Even if you wish to use a standard LaTeX
it may be preferable to make a TeX input file that first inputs 
<tt>latex.ltx</tt> then <tt>xmltex.tex</tt>. In particular this
will allow you to have a different hyphenation and language
customisation for xmltex than for LaTeX. Many of the features of
the language support in LaTeX are related to modifying the input
syntax to be more convenient. Such changes are not needed in xmltex as
the input syntax is always XML. Some language files may change the
meaning of such characters as &lt; which would break the xmltex parser.
Also, rather than using <tt>latex.ltx</tt> you could in principle
use a modified <tt>docstrip</tt> install file and produce a
`cut down' latex that did not have features that are not going to be
used in xmltex.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the support for this method of building xmltex (and access
to non English hyphenation generally) is not fully designed and totally
undocumented.</p>


<h2>
<a name="manualN343"></a>Using xmltex</h2>

<p>
xmltex by default `knows' nothing about any particular type of XML
file, and so needs to load external files containing specific
information. This section describes how the information in the XML
file determines which files will be loaded.

<ol>
<li> If the file begins with a Byte Order Mark, the default encoding
  is set to utf-16. Otherwise the default encoding is utf-8.
</li>
<li> If (after an optional BOM) the document begins with an XML
  declaration that specifies an encoding, this encoding will be used,
  otherwise the default encoding will be used. A file with name of the
  form <em>encoding</em><tt>.xmt</tt> will be loaded that maps the
  requested encoding to Unicode positions. (It is an error if this
  file does not exist for the requested encoding.)
</li>
<li> If the document has a <tt>DOCTYPE</tt> declaration that includes
  a local subset then this will be parsed. If any external DTD entity
  is referenced (by declaring and then referencing a parameter entity)
  then the SYSTEM and PUBLIC identifiers of this entity will be looked
  up in a catalogue (to be described below). If either identifier is
  known in the catalogue the corresponding xmltex package (often with
  <tt>.xmt</tt> extension) will be loaded.
</li>
<li> After any local subset has been processed, if the DOCTYPE
  specifies an external entity, the PUBLIC and/or SYSTEM identifiers
  of the external dtd file will be similarly looked up, and a
  corresponding xmltex file loaded if known.
</li>
<li> As each element is processed, it may be `known' to xmltex by
  virtue of one of the packages loaded, or it may be unknown. If it is
  unknown then if it is in a declared namespace, the namespace URI
  (not the prefix) is looked up in the xmltex catalogue. If the
  catalogue specifies an xmltex package for this namespace it will be
  loaded. If the element is not in a namespace, then the element name
  will be looked up in the catalogue.
</li>
<li> If after all these steps the element is still unknown then
  depending on the configuration setting either a warning or an error
  will be displayed. (Currently only warning implemented.)
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>
<a name="manualN398"></a>The xmltex Catalogue</h3>
<p>As discussed above, xmltex requires a mapping between PUBLIC and
SYSTEM identifiers, namespace URI, and element names, to files of
TeX code. This mapping is implemented by the following commands:
<pre>
<tt>\NAMESPACE</tt>{<em>URI</em>}{<em>xmt-file</em>}
<tt>\PUBLIC</tt>{<em>FPI</em>}{<em>file</em>}
<tt>\SYSTEM</tt>{<em>URI</em>}{<em>file</em>}
<tt>\NAME</tt>{<em>element-name</em>}{<em>xmt-file</em>}
<tt>\XMLNS</tt>{<em>element-name</em>}{<em>URI</em>}
</pre>
As described above, if the first argument of one of these commands
matches the string specified in the XML source file, the corresponding
TeX commands in the file specified in the second argument are
loaded. The PUBLIC and SYSTEM catalogue entries may also be used
to control which XML files should be input in response to external
entity references. The <tt>\XMLNS</tt> is rather different,
if an element in the null namespace does not have any definition
attatched to it, this declaration forces the default namespace to the
given URI. The catalogue lookup is then repeated. This allows for
example documents beginning <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> to be coerced into
the xhtml namespace.</p>
<p>These commands may be placed in a configuration file, either
<tt>xmltex.cfg</tt>, in which case they apply to all documents,
or in a configuration file `<tt>\jobname.cfg</tt>' (eg
<tt>document.cfg</tt> in the example in the Introduction) in which
case the commands just apply to the specified document.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="manualN490"></a>Configuring xmltex</h3>

<p>In addition to the `catalogue' commands described earlier there are
other commands that may be placed in the configuration files.

<ul>
<li> <p>
<tt>\xmltraceonly</tt>
</p>
<p>  This stops xml from trying to typeset the
  document. The external files specified in the catalogue are still
  loaded, so that the trace may report any elements for which no code
  is defined, but no actual typesetting takes place. In the event of
  unknown errors it is always worth using xmltex in this mode to
  isolate any problems.</p>
<p>It may be noted that if an xmltex format is built just using initex
without any typesetting commands, the resulting format should still
be able to parse any XML file if xmltex.cfg just specifies 
<tt>\xmltraceonly</tt> and \jobname.cfg is empty.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>
<tt>\xmltraceoff</tt>
</p>
<p>By default xmltex provides a trace of its XML parse, displaying
   each element begin and end. This command used in xmltex.cfg or
   `\jobname.cfg' will stop this trace being produced.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p> <tt>\inputonce</tt>{<em>xmt-file</em>}</p>
<p>The catalogue entries specify that
  certain files should be loaded if XML constructs are met.
  Alternatively the files may just always be loaded. The system will
  ignore any later requests to load. This is especially useful if an
  xmltex format is being made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<tt>\UnicodeCharacter</tt>{<em>hex-or-dec</em>}{<em>tex-code</em>}</p>
<p>The first argument specifies a unicode character number, in the same
format as used for XML character entities, namely either a decimal
number, or an upper case Hex number preceded by a lower case
`<tt>x</tt>'.</p>
<p>The second argument specifies arbitrary TeX code to be used when
typesetting this character. Any code in the XML
range may be specified (ie up to x10FFFF). Although codes in the
`ASCII' range, below 128, may be specified, the definitions supplied
for such characters will not be default be used. The definition will
howeverbe stored and used if the character is activated using the
command described below.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>
<tt>\ActivateASCII</tt>{<em>hex-or-dec</em>}</p>
<p>The argument to this command should be a number less than 128.
If a character us activated by this command in a configuration file
then any special typesetting instructions specified for the character
will be executed whenever the character appears as character data.</p>
<p>Some ASCII characters are activated by default. The list is
essentially those characters with special meanings to either TeX or
XML.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
If a format is being made, there are essentially two copies of
<tt>xmltex.cfg</tt> that may play a role. The configuration file
input when the format is made will control catalogue entries and
packages built into the format. A possibly different
<tt>xmltex.cfg</tt> may be used in the input path of `normal' TeX,
this will then be used for additional information loaded each run.</p>
<p>In either case, a separate configuration file specific to the given
XML document may also be used (which is loaded immediately after
<tt>xmltex.cfg</tt>).
</p>



<h2>
<a name="stopping"></a>Stopping xmltex</h2>

<p>xmltex  should stop after the end of the document
element has been processed. If things go wrong and
you end up at the interactive
<tt>*</tt> prompt  you might want to exit with
<tt>&lt;?xmltex \stop?&gt;</tt>).
</p>


<h2>
<a name="manualN651"></a>xmltex package files</h2>

<p>
xmltex package files are the link between the XML markup and TeX
typesetting code. They are written in TeX (rather than XML) syntax
and may load directly or indirectly other files, including LaTeX
class and package files. For example a file loaded for a particular
document type may directly execute <tt>\LoadClass{article}</tt>, or
alternatively it may cause some XML element in the document to
execute <tt>\documentclass{article}</tt>. In either case the document will
suffer the dubious benefit of being formatted based on the style
implemented in <tt>article.cls</tt>. Beware though that the package
files may be loaded at strange times, the first time a given namespace
is declared in a document, and so the code should be written to work
if loaded inside a local group.</p>
<p>Characters in xmltex package files have their normal LaTeX meanings
except that line endings are ignored so that you do not need to add
a % to the end of lines in macro code. Unlike fd file conventions, other
white space is <em>not</em> ignored.</p>
<p>The available commands are:

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<tt>\FileEncoding</tt>{<em>encoding</em>}</p>
<p>This is the analogue for TeX syntax files of the encoding specification
in the XML or text declaration of XML files. If it is not specified the
file will be assumed to be in UTF-8.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\DeclareNamespace</tt>{<em>prefix</em>}{<em>URI</em>}</p>
<p>This declares a prefix to be used <em>in this file</em> for referring to
elements in the specified namespace. If the prefix is empty then this
declares the default namespace (otherwise, unprefixed element names
refer to elements that are not in a namespace).</p>
<p>Note that the elements in the XML document instance may use a
different prefix, or no prefix at all to access this namespace.
In order to resolve these different prefixes for the same namespace,
each time a namespace is encountered for the first time (either 
by <tt>\DeclareNamespace</tt> in a preloaded package, or in a namespace
declaration in the XML instance) then it is allocated a new number
and any further namespace declaration for the same URI just locally
associates a prefix with this number. It is these numbers that are
displayed when the XML trace of the parse of the document is shown,
and also if any element is written out to an external file it will
have a normalised prefix of a number whichever prefix it had
originally. (Numeric prefixes are not legal XML, but this is an
advantage, it ensures these internal forms can not clash with any
prefix actually used in the document.)</p>
<p>Three namespaces are predeclared. The null namespace (0), the XML
namespace (<tt>http://www.w3.org/1998/xml</tt>) (1) which is predeclaed
with prefix <tt>xml</tt> as specified in the Namespace Recommendation,
and the xmltex namespace
(<tt>http://www.dcarlisle.demon.co.uk/xmltex</tt>) (2) which is not
given a default prefix, but may be used to have XML syntax for some
internal commands (eg to have .aux files fully in XML, currently they
are a hybrid mixture of some TeX and some XML syntax).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
  <tt>\XMLelement</tt>{<em>element-qname</em>}{<em>attribute-spec</em>}
{<em>begin-code</em>}{<em>end-code</em>}</p>
<p>  This is similar to a LaTeX <tt>\newenvironment</tt> command.</p>
<p> Declare the code to execute at the start and end of each instance of
this element type. This code will be executed in a local group (like a
LaTeX environment). The second argument declares a list of attributes
and their default values using the <tt>\XMLattribute</tt> command
described below.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 
  <tt>\XMLelement</tt>{<em>element-qname</em>}
{<em>attribute-spec</em>}
<tt>{\xmlgrab}</tt>{<em>end-code</em>}</p>
<p>  A special case of the above command (which may be better made into a
  separate declaration) is to make the <em>start-code</em> just be the command
  <tt>\xmlgrab</tt>. In this case the <em>end-code</em> has access to the
  element content (in XML syntax) as <tt>#1</tt>. This content isn't
  literally the same as the original document, namespaces, white space
  and attribute quote symbols will all have been normalised.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>
  <tt>\XMLattribute</tt>{<em>attribute-qname</em>}
{<em>command-name</em>}{<em>default</em>}</p>
<p>This command may only be used in the argument to
<tt>\XMLelement</tt>.
 The first argument specifies the name of an attribute (using any
 namespace prefixes current for this package file, which need not
 be the same as the prefixes used in the document).
 The second argument gives a TeX command name that will be used to
 access the value of this attribute in the begin and end code for the
 element. (Note using TeX syntax here provides a name independednt of
 the namespace declarations that are in scope when this code is executed).
 The third argument provides a default value that wil be used if the
attribute is not used on an instance of this element.
 </p>
<p>The special token <tt>\inherit</tt> may be used which will cause
the command to have a value set in an ancestor element if this element
does not specify any value.</p>
<p>If a TeX token such as <tt>\relax</tt> is used as the default
the element code may distinguish the case that the attribute is not used
in the document.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>
  <tt>\XMLnamespaceattribute</tt>
{<em>prefix</em>}{<em>attribute-qname</em>}
{<em>command-name</em>}{<em>default</em>}</p>
<p>This command is similar to <tt>\XMLattribute</tt>
 but is used at the top level of the package file, not in the argument
to <tt>\XMLelement</tt>. It is equivalent to specifying the
attribute in <em>every</em> element in the namespace specified by
the first argument. As usual the prefix (which may be {} to denote the
default namespace) refers to the namespace declarations in the xmltex
package: the prefixes used in the document may be different.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\XMLentity</tt>{<em>name</em>}{<em>code</em>}</p>
<p>Declare an (internal parsed) entity, this is equivalent to a
<tt>&lt;!ENTITY</tt> declaration, except that the
replacement text is specified in TeX syntax.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\XMLname</tt>{<em>name</em>}{<em>command-name</em>}</p>
<p>Declare the TeX command to hold the (normalised, internal form) of
the XML name given in the first argument. This allows the code specified in
<tt>\XMLelement</tt> to refer to XML element names without knowing
the encodings or namespace prefixes used in the document. Of particular
use might be to compare such a name with <tt>\ifx\XML@parent</tt>
which will allow element code to take different actions depending on
the parent of the current element.</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
<tt>\XMLstring</tt>{<em>command-name</em>}&lt;&gt;<em>XML Data</em>&lt;/&gt;</p>
<p>This saves the XML fragment as the TeX command given in the first
argument. It may be particularly useful for redefining `fixed strings'
that are generated by LaTeX document classes to use any special
typesetting rules specified for individual characters.</p>
<p>It should also be used for defining any strings used to
in comparison tests with strings occurring in the XML document.
Using <tt>\XMLstring</tt> rather than <tt>\def</tt> ensures
that the characters and encodings in the string are correctly normalised.</p>
</li>


</ul>

</p>

<h2>
<a name="manualN1004"></a>XML processing</h2>

<p>
xmltex tries as far as possible to be a fully conforming non
validating parser. It fails in the following respects.
<ul>
<li> Error reporting is virtually non existent. Names are not checked
  against the list of allowed characters, and various other
  constraints are not enforced.
</li>
<li>
<p> A non validating parser is not forced to read external dtd
  entities (and this one does not) It is obliged to read the local
  subset and process entity definitions and attribute declarations.
  Entity declarations are reasonably well handled: External parameter
  entities are handled as above, loading a corresponding xmltex file
  if known. External entities are similarly processed, inputting
  the XML file, a difference in this case is that if the entity is not
  found in the catalogue, the SYSTEM identifier will be used directly
  to <tt>\input</tt> as often this is a local file reference. Internal
  parsed entities and parameter entities are essentially treated as
  TeX macros, and nonparsed entities are saved along with their
  NDATA type, for use presumably by <tt>\includegraphics</tt>.</p>
<p>Attribute defaults are processed in the local subset of the dtd, however
   note that this is `namespace unaware' defaulting and only applies to
   elements using the same prefix and local name, unlike the defaulting
   done by <tt>\XMLattribute</tt>. </p>  
</li>
<li>
<p> Support for encodings depends on having an encoding mapping
  file. Any 8bit encoding that matches Unicode for the first 127 positions
  may be used by making a trivial mapping file. (The one for latin1
  looks over complicated as it programs a loop rather than having 127
  declarations saying that latin1 and Unicode are identical in this
  range).</p>
<p>  UTF-8 is supported, but support for UTF-16 is minimal. Currently
  only latin-1 values work: (In this range UTF-16 is just latin-1 with
  a null byte inserted after (or before, depending on endedness)
  each latin-1 byte. The UTF-16 implementation just ignores this null
  byte then processes as for latin-1. Probably the first few 8bit
  pages could be similarly supported by making the low ascii control
  characters activate UTF-16 processing but this will never be
  satisfactory using a standard TeX. Hopefully a setup for a 16bit
  TeX such as Omega will correct this.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>
<a name="manualN1059"></a>Accessing TeX</h2>

<p>In theory you should be able to control the document just be suitable
code specified by <tt>\XMLelement</tt> and friends, but sometimes it may be
necessary to `tweak' the output by placing commands directly in the
source.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms are availalable to do this.
<ul>
<li>
<p> Using the xmltex namespace. The xmltex namespace conatins a
  small (currently empty) set of useful TeX constructs that are
  accessed by XML syntax. For example if xmltex provides a mechanism
  for having XML (rather than LaTeX) syntax toc files, it will need
  an analogue of <tt>\contentsline</tt> which might be an element
  accessed by <tt>&lt;xmltex:contentsline&gt;</tt>&hellip; where the xmltex
  prefix is declared on this or a parent element to be
 <tt>xmlns:xmltex="http://www.dcarlisle.demon.co.uk/xmltex"</tt>.</p>
<p>  As the xmltex namespace is declared but currently empty, a more
  useful variant of this might be:</p>
</li>
<li> Declare your own namespace for TeX tweaks, and load a suitable
  package file that attatches TeX code to the elements in this
  namespace (or at least specify the correspondence between the
  namespace and the package using <tt>\NAMESPACE</tt>).
  For instance if you put <tt>&lt;clearpage xmlns="/my/tex/tweak"/&gt;</tt>
  in your document, this will force a page break if you have at
  suitable points, <tt>\NAMESPACE{/my/tex/tweak}{tweak.xmt}</tt>
  and
<pre>
\DeclareNamespace{tweak}{"/my/tex/tweak"}
\XMLelement{tweak:clearpage}{\clearpage}
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p> A second different mechanism is available, to use XML processing
  instructions. A Processing Instruction of the form:
<tt>&lt;?xmltex&gt;</tt>  <em>TeX commands</em> <tt>?&gt;</tt>
will execute the TeX commands.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</p>


<h2>
<a name="manualN1146"></a>Bugs</h2>

<p>None, of course.</p>


<h2>
<a name="manualN1161"></a>Don't Read Past This Point</h2>

<p>Thus section discusses some of the more experimental features of xmltex
that may get a cleaner syntax (or be removed, as a bad idea) in later releases,
and also describes some of the internal interfaces (which are also
subject to change)</p>

<h3>
<a name="manualN1175"></a>Input Encodings and States</h3>

<p>At any point while processing a document, xmltex is in one of two 
<em>states</em>: <em>tex</em> or <em>xml</em>.</p>
<h4>
<a name="manualN1201"></a>States</h4>
<p>In the xml <em>state</em>,
 &lt; and &amp; are the only two characters that
trigger special markup codes. Other characters, such as !, &gt;, =,
&hellip; may be used in certain XML constructs as markup but unless
some code has been triggered by &lt; they are treated simply as
character data. All characters above 127 are `active' to TeX
and are used to translate the input encoding to UTF-8. All internal
character handling is based on UTF-8, as described below. Some
characters in the ASCII range, below 127 are also active by default
(mainly punctuation characters used in XML constructs, such as
the ones listed above). Some or all of the others may be activated
using the <tt>\ActivateASCII</tt> command, which allows special
typesetting rules to be activated for the characters, at some cost in
processing speed.</p>
<p>In the tex <em>state</em>,
characters in the ASCII range have their usual
TeX meanings, so letters are `catcode 11' and may be used in TeX
control sequences, \ is the escape character, &amp; the table cell
separator, etc. Characters above 127 have the meanings current for the
current encoding just as for the xml state, probably this means that
they are unusable in TeX code, except for the special case of
referring to XML element names in the first argument to
<tt>\XMLelement</tt> and releated commands.</p>

<h4>
<a name="manualN1233"></a>Encodings</h4>
<p>Whenever a new (XML or TeX) file is input by the xmltex system the
<em>encoding</em> is first switched to UTF-8. At the end of the
input the encoding is returned to whatever was the current encoding.
The encoding current while the file is read is determined by the
encoding pseudo-attribute on the XML or text declaration in the case
of XML files, or by the <tt>\FileEncoding</tt> command for TeX
files. Note that the encoding mechanism <em>only</em> is triggered
by xmltex file includes. Once an xmltex package file is loaded it may
include other TeX files by <tt>\input</tt> or
<tt>\includepackage</tt> these input command swill be transparent
to the xmltex encoding system. The vast majority of TeX macro
packages only use ASCII characters so this should not be a
problem.</p>
<p>Note that if the <tt>\includepackage</tt> occurs directly in
the xmltex package file, the TeX code will be included with a known
encoding, the one specified in the xmltex package, or UTF-8. If
however the <tt>\includepackage</tt> is included in code specified
by <tt>\XMLelement</tt>, then it will be executed with whatever
encoding is current in the document at the point that element is
reached. Before xmltex executes the code for that element it will
switch to the tex state, thus normalising the ascii characters
but characters above 127 will not have predefined definitions in this
case.</p>
<p>Internally eveything is stored as UTF-8. So `aux' and `toc' files
will be in UTF-8 even if the document (or parts of the document) used
different encodings.</p>
<p>To specify a new encoding, if it is an 8 bit encoding that matches
ASCII in the printable ASCII range, then one just needs to produce a
file with name <em>encoding</em><tt>.xmt</tt> (in lowercase,
on case sensitive systems) this should consist of a series of
<tt>\InputCharacter</tt> commands, giving the input character slot
and the equivalent Unicode. If an encoding is specified in this manner
character data will be converted to UTF-8 by <em>expansion</em>
and so ligatures and inter letter kerns will be preserved. (Conversely
if characers are accessed by character references, &amp;#1234; then
TeX arithmetic is used to decode the information and ligature
information will be lost. For some large character sets, especially
for Asian languages, these mechanisms will probably not prove to be
sufficient, some mechanisms are being investigated, but in the short
term it may be necessary to always use UTF-8 if the input encoding
is not strictly a ine byte extension of the ASCII code page.

<h3>
<a name="manualN1298"></a>xmltex Package Commands</h3>

<p>You can use arbitrary TeX commands in an xmltex package,
althought you should be aware that the file may be input into a local
group, at the point in a document that a particular namespace is first
used, for example. There are however some specific commands designed
to be used in the begin or end code of <tt>\XMLElement</tt>.
<ul>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\ignorespaces</tt>
</p>
<p>This is actually a TeX primitive
(for the moment!)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\obeyspaces</tt>
</p>
<p>Obey consecutive space characters,
rather than treating consecutive runs as a single space.
(A command of this name, but not this definition is in plain TeX.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\obeylines</tt>
</p>
<p>Obey end of line characters,
rather than treating then as a space, force a line break.
(A command of this name, but not this definition is in plain TeX.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\xmltexfirstchild#1\@</tt>
</p>
<p>If the <em>start-code</em> for an element is specified as
<tt>\xmlgrab</tt> then the  <em>end-code</em> may use
<tt>#1</tt> in order to execute the element content. Sometimes you
do not want all of the content. The a construction (with currently
unpleasant syntax) <tt>\xmltexfirstchild#1\@</tt> will just evaluate
the first child element of the content, discarding the remaining
elements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\xmltextwochildren\csa\csb#1</tt>
</p>
<p>If you know that the content will be exactly two child elements (for
examle a MathML frac or sub element) then this command may be used.
It will execute the TeX code 
<tt>\csa{</tt><em>child-1</em><tt>}\csb{</tt><em>child-2</em>
So either two TeX command smay be supplied, one will be applied to
each child, or the second argument may be <tt>{}</tt> in which case
the first argument may be a TeX command that takes two arguments.
For example the code for MathMl frac might be
<pre>
\XMLelement{m:mfrac}
  {}
  {\xmlgrab}
  {\xmltextwochildren\frac{}#1}
</pre>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\xmltexthreechildren\csa\csb\csc#1</tt>
</p>
<p>As above, but more so.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\xmltexforall\csa{#1}</tt>
</p>
<p>The TeX command <tt>\csa</tt> is called repeatedly,
taking each child element of the current element as argument
on each iteration. As a convenience the command <tt>\xml@name</tt>
is defined before each iteration to have the (internal, normalised)
name of the element being processed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<tt>\NDATAEntity\csa\csb\attvalue</tt>
</p>
<p>If the XML parser encounters an internalor external entity reference
it expands it without executing any special hook that may be defined in
an xmltex package. However NDATA entites are never directly encountered
in an entity reference. They may only be used as an attribute value.
If <tt>\attvalue</tt>. is a TeX command holding the value of an
attribute, as declared in <tt>\XMLattribute</tt> then
<tt>\NDATAEntity\csa\csb\attvalue</tt> applies the two TeX
commands <tt>\csa</tt> and <tt>\csb</tt> to the notation type
and the value, in a way exactly corresponding to
<tt>\xmltextwochildren</tt> so for example the XML document for this
manual specifies
<pre>
 &lt;!NOTATION URL SYSTEM "" &gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY lppl SYSTEM "http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt" NDATA URL&gt;
</pre>
and this is handled by the following xmltex code
<pre>
\XMLelement{xptr}
 {\XMLattribute{doc}{\xptrdoc}{}}
 {\NDATAEntity\xptrdoc\@gobble\url}
 {}
</pre>
which saves the attribute value in  <tt>\xptrdoc</tt> and then
discards the notation name (URL) and applies the command
<tt>\url</tt> to typeset the supplied URL.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
