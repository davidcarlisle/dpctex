<sec><head>Heading <it>iii</it> example (123) </head>
<p>
This is an example of an experimental mode in which some
of the characters in the standard `ascii' range are given special
definitions. Vowels are made red, and digits (0123456789) are typeset in
oldstyle form. Note that you may still use the sepcial letters as part
of XML names, for example the follwoin word is set using the element `it':
<it>italic</it>.
</p>
<p>
While the special definitions apply to any text originating in the XML
document they do not apply to texts coming from the TeX code and in
particular from LaTeX packages. Note in this example that the
section numbers are not old style and the vowels in the word `contents'
are not coloured.
