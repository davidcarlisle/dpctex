\ProvidesPackage{nopageno}[1989/01/01 no page numbers (DPC)]
% Actually the above date is probably wrong, I can not remember
% How long I have had this lying around...

% LaTeX's standard styles use two page styles, one on normal
% pages and one on `opening' pages with \maketitle or \chapter etc.
% Unfortunately there is only easy access to changing one of these
% two so if you want something other than `plain' on the opening
% pages you must use \thispagestyle{...} on _each_ such page.

% The fancyheadings package does provide a more flexible interface,
% but if you just want an empty page style on all pages then
% \usepackage{nopageno}
% will do the job.

% Another 4 token package...
