I shall add new files here from time to time, currently the directory
contains the following.

nopageno.sty
   This file has now moved: see macros/latex/contrib/nopageno

blkarray.sty
   This file has now moved: see macros/latex/contrib/blkarray

ltxtable.tex
   This generates and documents the package ltxtable.sty. A merger of
   longtable and tabularx packages from the Standard LaTeX tools
   collection. This produces multipage tables in which the column
   widths are automatically calculated to achieve a specified total
   table width.

mylatex.ltx
   This file provides a method of making a special format tailored to
   one document, with all the class and packages, and other preamble
   material pre-loaded. This can save quite a lot of time on some
   systems. See the comments in the file.

typehtml.dtx
typehtml.ins
   These files have moved: see macros/latex/contrib/typehtml

plain.sty
   Typeset plain TeX markup in LaTeX documents.
   Within \begin{plain} ... \end{plain} most plain TeX constructs work
   including commands such as \over which might have been disabled by
   other LaTeX packages such as amsmath.

comma.sty
   These files have moved: see macros/latex/contrib/comma

colortbl.dtx
colortbl.ins
   These files have moved: see macros/latex/contrib/colortbl

dotlessj.sty
   If you are using a font set without a dotless j (\j and \jmath) then
   this package will fake one. It requires the LaTeX color package.
   It does not require any explicit PostScript support.

textcase.dtx
textcase.ins
   These files have moved: see macros/latex/contrib/textcase

remreset.sty
   \@removefromreset: a companion to the standard \@addtoreset command
   allows counters to be removed from the reset list of a controlling
   counter. For example, a class file based on book class may say
   \@removefromreset{footnote}{chapter}
   so that footnotes are no longer reset every chapter (the book class
   default).

scalefnt.sty
   \scalefont{2} selects the current font in twice the current size.
   \scalefont{.75} reduces the current font size by three quarters.

fix2col.dtx
fix2col.ins
   These files have moved: see macros/latex/contrib/fix2col

slashed.sty
   Commands for the `Feynman slashed character' notation.

pspicture.ins
pspicture.dtx
   These files have now moved: see macros/latex/contrib/pspicture

tabulary.dtx

   These files have now moved: see macros/latex/contrib/tabulary
